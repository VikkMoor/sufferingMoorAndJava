## SEM1:
### Lesson tasks:
* Name: just "hi, username!"; 
* Number: try same with number;
* NameHours: greeting relative to current time;
* SameNumsRow: show the maximum number of digits "1" in a row in array;
* EqualToEnd (1,2): move all given equal numbers to the end of the array;
* RevSent: reverse words in a sentence;
* Pow: raise number 'a' to the power 'b';
### Homework (autotests):
* Answer: to get prime numbers in 1...1000; 
* Answer1: to get triangle number;
* Calculator: calculator, hee hee;
* Bufreadtest: just testing BufferedReader for myself;


## SEM2:
### Lesson tasks: 
* loggerExample: some simple examples;
* sem2task2: input even N (>0), symbols c1, c2, output string c1c2c1c2...N;
* zip: make the string with each unique symbol and how much of them;
* palindrome: made with one string replaces & reverse & so on;
### Homework (autotests):
* Answer1: given a sql query string, generate it "where" part, using StringBuilder

  (if the value is 'null' then the parameter should not be included in the request);
* BubbleSort: after each iteration code should write to a log file 'log.txt'

  (in the format "year-month-day hour:minutes");


## SEM3 (lists):
### Lesson tasks:
* ListExample1: to fill the list (with random numbers) + sort;
* ListExample2/3: to fill the list and remove integers (with iterator);
* ShopBook: the bookstore catalog is saved as a two-dimensional list:

  List<ArrayList<String>>, so that the 0th position of each internal list contains
  the name of the genre, and the rest positions - book titles.
  
  Write a method to populate this structure (but with only unique values);
### Homework (autotests):
* MergeSort;
* Answer: method for remove even numbers from list;
* Answer2: to sort list and find min/max/average;


## SEM4:
### Lesson tasks:
* S4t1: receives a string of the form like: "text~num".

  Need to split the string by ~, save text's part into a linked list at position 'num'.

  If print~num is entered, have to show the string at position 'num' in the list and remove it.
* S4t2: make the console application that:

  Receives strings from the user and 'remembers' them.

  If 'print' is entered, the string is output like LIFO.

  If 'revert' is entered, delete the previous text entered from memory.
* Task3: ;
### Homework (autotests):
* RevertList: to make the reverse LinkedList;
* MyQueue:
  In the class 'MyQueue' make next methods with LinkedList:
  - enqueue() - put the element to the end;
  - dequeue() - return the 1st element and delete it;
  - first() - return the 1st element without deleting;
  - getElements() - return all elements;
* Calculator: like in first seminar, but make it possible to undo the last operation
  and show the result of previous;
